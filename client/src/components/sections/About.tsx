            I am a final year Computer Science student at JSS Academy of
            Technical Education, Noida with a knack for Web Development and a
            growing interest in Machine Learning. I love bringing ideas to life
            through React and creating intuitive, user-friendly web experiences.
            I believe in continuous learning and love exploring new
            technologies. Whether itâ€™s solving a complex problem or designing a
            seamless UI, I enjoy the process of building and improving.<br></br>
            <br></br>
            Currently, Iâ€™m looking for internship opportunities where I can
            apply my skills, learn from real-world challenges, and contribute
            meaningfully. If you're looking for a dedicated developer whoâ€™s
            eager to grow,Â letâ€™sÂ connect! <br></br>
            <br></br>Letâ€™s build something incredible together!Â ðŸš€
